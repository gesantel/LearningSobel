# Learning Sobel

See Substack post [here](https://georgesantellano.substack.com/publish/post/181097416).

The goal of this project was to see how well different architectures learn the size k Sobel filter for k = 3,5,7,9. We add gaussian noise w/ std deviations sigma =  0,.1, .5, .2. We construct phase diagrams for our architectures on the parameter spaces for k and noise.
